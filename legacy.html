            <p>This is the beginning of a legacy. Not only a legacy but the beginning of a hope that this legacy will become the future of all writing frontiersmen and women alike. This blog spot is for the importing of collective ideas, frames of mind, stories, fact or fiction, experience or fairy tale, mini-series, movie or dramatized reenactment</p>
              <p>Before we go any further I want to talk a little about a man named Rogain. At one time he was little known and little cared for and very secretive. Ever so often Rogaine was reminded that he was given a gift. Now Rogaine himself was interested in many things and loved mother nature, he liked video cameras and was very fond of old style cameras and how to do photography and develop film.  </p>
